### Setup
After having installed node, `cd` into the viktor-frontend folder and run `npm install`.  
When the dependencies finish installing, run `npm run build` to create a build folder.  
Keep this build folder, you will need it for the backend setup.  
Now go to the viktor-backend readme.md and follow the instructions there.

### Usage
After you've setup the backend, go to the ip of the host of the backend server. If you are hosting it on the computer you're reading this on, go to `http://localhost:PORT` where port is the port you selected for the backend. (default 8080)  
On that page you should see a login screen. The default password is `hunter2`.
